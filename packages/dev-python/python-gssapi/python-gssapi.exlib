SUMMARY="Python binding to the Generic Security Service
Application Program Interface (GSSAPI)."
DESCRIPTION="
The GSSAPI provides a uniform interface to security services which
applications can use without having to worry about implementation
details of the underlying mechanisms. The most commonly used
mechanism is Kerberos v5, and this package provides an easy way
to use Kerberos authentication and security from Python code.
