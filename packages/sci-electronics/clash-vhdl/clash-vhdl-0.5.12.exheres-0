SUMMARY="CAES Language for Synchronous Hardware - VHDL backend"
DESCRIPTION="
CÎ»aSH (pronounced âclashâ) is a functional hardware description language that
borrows both its syntax and semantics from the functional programming language
Haskell. The CÎ»aSH compiler transforms these high-level descriptions to
low-level synthesizable VHDL, Verilog, or SystemVerilog.

Features of CÎ»aSH:

* Strongly typed (like VHDL), yet with a very high degree of type inference,
which enables both safe and fast prototying using consise descriptions (like
Verilog)

* Interactive REPL: load your designs in an interpreter and easily test all
your component without needing to setup a test bench.

* Higher-order functions, with type inference, result in designs that are
fully parametric by default.

* Synchronous sequential circuit design based on streams of values, called
Signals.

* Support for multiple clock domains, with type safe clock domain crossing.


This package provides:

* VHDL Backend
