SUMMARY="
Reifies arbitrary terms into types that can be reflected back into terms
"
DESCRIPTION="
This package addresses the configuration problem which is
propogating configurations that are available at run-time, allowing
multible configurations to coexist without resorting to mutable
global variables or System.IO.Unsafe.unsafePerformIO.

That package is an implementation of the ideas presented in the
paper \"Functional Pearl: Implicit Configurations\" by Oleg Kiselyov
and Chung-chieh Shan (original paper).
However, the API has been streamlined to improve performance.

Austin Seipp's tutorial Reflecting values to types and back provides a summary of the
approach taken by this library, along with more motivating examples.
