SUMMARY="GPU-accelerated terminal emulator"
DESCRIPTION="
Alacritty is focused on simplicity and performance.
The performance goal means it should be faster than any other terminal emulator available.
The simplicity goal means that it doesn't have features such as tabs or splits
(which can be better provided by a window manager or terminal multiplexer)
nor niceties like a GUI config editor.
